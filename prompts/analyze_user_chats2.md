# Claude Code Collaboration Insights Extraction Prompt

## Effective Collaboration Pattern Discovery System

You are a collaboration analyst specializing in extracting actionable patterns for working effectively with users to deliver bug-free, high-quality code.

Task: Extract insights about what makes the user satisfied, what prevents bugs, and how to collaborate effectively - learning from both successes and friction points in past conversations.

## Success Metrics:
- Identify patterns that lead to successful implementations
- Capture bug prevention strategies that worked
- Document what makes user happy vs frustrated
- Extract quality assurance approaches that prevent rework
- Create actionable guidelines for future interactions
- **COLLABORATION FOCUS**: How to work together effectively, not profiling the user

## Workflow:
1. Read chats.md file which contains list of all chat sessions with metadata
2. Each entry has format: [ ] **Session ID**: uuid followed by project path, file name, timestamps, etc.
3. Chat files are located in: `~/.claude/projects/[encoded-project-path]/[session-id].jsonl`
   - Project paths are encoded by replacing `/` with `-`
   - Example: `/Users/Duracula/1/Python/Projects/memory` → `-Users-Duracula-1-Python-Projects-memory`
4. Identify 5 unprocessed chat sessions (those without [X] mark) from chats.md
5. Create TodoWrite list with all 5 sessions as separate tasks using Session ID
6. Process each chat file one by one, marking as in_progress when starting
7. **For each chat, extract messages efficiently:**
   - Run: `python3 utils/extract_chat_messages.py ~/.claude/projects/[encoded-path]/[session-id].jsonl markdown`
   - This script extracts user AND assistant messages in markdown format, filtering out:
     - Tool use (function calls, file operations)
     - Code editing content
     - System messages
   - Output contains conversational content only in readable markdown
   - **Focus analysis on USER messages** but keep assistant context for understanding
   - If extraction fails or file is still too large, fall back to batch reading:
     - Use Read tool with offset/limit: read in ~20k token batches
     - Example: `Read(file_path, offset=0, limit=500)` then `offset=500, limit=500` etc.
8. **Search memory for existing patterns before extracting new ones:**
   - Use search_similar with entityTypes=["implementation_pattern", "debugging_pattern", "configuration_pattern"]
   - Check if technical insights, workflows, or preferences already exist
   - Only extract and store NEW insights or significant updates to existing ones
   - Avoid duplicating patterns already well-documented in memory
9. Extract insights from BOTH perspectives:
   
   **From USER messages:**
   - How user asks for features
   - Testing preferences and quality expectations
   - Communication style and preferences
   - Project vision and priorities
   - Personal workflow patterns
   
   **From ASSISTANT's valuable insights:**
   - Research findings and technical discoveries
   - Workflow optimizations suggested and accepted
   - Architecture insights and "how it works" explanations
   - Performance patterns and debugging solutions
   - Market/competitor analysis performed
   - Implementation approaches that user approved
   - Data handling preferences (validation, storage, structure)
   - System flow patterns (async/sync, error propagation)
   - Development workflow sequences that worked well
   - Data pipeline architectures user embraced
   - Testing strategies that caught bugs effectively
   - Code organization preferences (file structure, naming)
   - Documentation standards that prevent confusion
   - Review/feedback patterns that speed iterations
   - Integration testing approaches user trusts
   - Deployment workflows that ensure quality
   - **Only save if user acknowledged/accepted the insight**
10. Mark todo as completed and update chats.md:
    - [X] for processed sessions
    - Skip sessions with minimal content (<5 user messages)
11. Write findings to user_claude_analysis.md:
    - **Append insights to the end of the file** (no need to organize yet)
    - Write each chat's insights as a separate section with session ID
    - **Prioritize exact user quotes** over summaries
    - **Focus on specific insights**: What worked, what failed, why
    - **Include context**: When user said it, what problem they were solving
    - **Capture decisions**: What user chose and their reasoning
    - Less narrative, more raw data points for later synthesis

**Important**: Use chats.md only for tracking which sessions to process. Actual chat content must be parsed from the JSONL files in the Claude projects directory. All insights should be written to user_claude_analysis.md, NOT stored in memory.

## Collaboration Success Analysis Areas:

### Bug Prevention Patterns:
- **Pre-implementation checks**: What prevents bugs before coding starts?
- **Testing approaches that work**: Which testing methods catch issues early?
- **Code review triggers**: When does user catch problems vs when do they slip through?
- **Success indicators**: What patterns lead to "works perfectly" responses?
- **Failure patterns**: What approaches consistently lead to bugs or rework?

### User Satisfaction Drivers:
- **Happy path indicators**: What makes user respond positively?
- **Friction points**: What causes frustration or repeated corrections?
- **Trust builders**: What increases user confidence in solutions?
- **Efficiency patterns**: What speeds up development without sacrificing quality?
- **Communication effectiveness**: Which explanation styles prevent misunderstandings?

### Project Vision & Priorities:
- **Core values**: What matters most to the user about the project?
- **Use cases**: How user describes intended usage
- **Future plans**: Features or improvements user mentions wanting
- **Domain expertise**: User's knowledge level and specialties
- **Business context**: Any mentioned goals or constraints

### Strategic & Business Insights:
- **Product direction**: Where is the code/project heading? Long-term vision?
- **UI/UX perspective**: User's thoughts on interface, user experience design
- **Marketing angle**: How user talks about positioning, target audience, value prop
- **Client needs**: What end users or clients need, pain points to solve
- **Business model**: Monetization thoughts, pricing, market strategy
- **Competitive view**: How user compares to alternatives or competitors
- **Success metrics**: What user defines as success for the project
- **Balance decisions**: Speed vs quality, features vs stability, cost vs performance
- **Project philosophy**: Open source vs proprietary, build vs buy, simple vs powerful

### Effective Development Workflow:
- **Successful patterns**: What workflow approaches lead to bug-free implementations?
- **Quality checkpoints**: Where in the workflow should validation occur?
- **Iteration sweet spot**: When to show progress vs when to complete fully?
- **Documentation needs**: What documentation prevents future bugs?
- **Code organization**: What structure makes user's review easier?

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Actionable Collaboration Insights
- **PATTERN RECOGNITION**: Focus on what works vs what fails
- **BUG PREVENTION**: Extract strategies that prevent issues before they occur
- **SATISFACTION DRIVERS**: Identify what makes collaboration smooth
- **FRICTION REDUCTION**: Document what causes rework or frustration
- **QUALITY PATTERNS**: Capture approaches that consistently deliver bug-free code
- **PRACTICAL FOCUS**: Save actionable patterns, not observations about personality
- **EVIDENCE-BASED**: Look for patterns repeated across multiple conversations
- **FUTURE-ORIENTED**: Focus on "how to work together better" not "what user is like"

## Technical Detail Handling:
- **SEARCH FIRST**: Use search_similar with entityTypes=["function", "class", "metadata"] to check if technical detail already exists
- **USER PREFERENCE FILTER**: Only save technical details that reveal:
  - User's preferred approach or methodology
  - Quality standards or testing requirements
  - Architecture decisions that show user's vision
  - Tool/library choices that indicate workflow preferences
- **SKIP PURE IMPLEMENTATION**: Don't store code solutions unless they demonstrate user's unique approach
- **EXAMPLE**: User saying "always use async/await" reveals preference; just implementing async code doesn't

## Tools Required:
- **Use appropriate mcp__*-memory__ prefix** for searching existing patterns
- **search_similar**: Check if patterns already exist before documenting
- **Write/Edit tools**: Append insights to user_claude_analysis.md file
- **No memory storage**: All insights go to the file for later review

## Processing Instructions:
- **SEARCH STRATEGY**: Use entityTypes=["knowledge_insight", "configuration_pattern"] for user preferences
- **CHAT PARSING**: Skip Claude's responses entirely unless user directly references them
- **PREFERENCE DETECTION**: Look for:
  * Repeated requests or patterns
  * Expressed frustrations or satisfactions  
  * Workflow descriptions or requirements
  * Quality standards or expectations
  * Personal anecdotes or context
- **SYNTHESIS APPROACH**: Combine insights from multiple chats into cohesive patterns
- **CATEGORIZATION**: Primarily use:
  * knowledge_insight - User preferences, communication style, project vision
  * configuration_pattern - Workflow preferences, tool choices, setup preferences
  * ideas - Future features or improvements user mentioned

## Structured Observation Format:
For user preference entries, use clear sections:
- **Communication Style**: How user prefers to interact
- **Testing Approach**: Quality expectations and validation methods
- **Project Priorities**: What matters most to the user
- **Workflow Patterns**: How user likes to work
- **Key Phrases**: Exact quotes showing preferences
- **Evolution**: How preferences changed over chats

## Category Classification for User Insights:
1. **knowledge_insight** - User preferences, communication patterns, project understanding
   - *Indicators*: "I prefer", "always", "never", "make sure", "important to me"
2. **configuration_pattern** - Tool preferences, workflow choices, environment setup
   - *Indicators*: "I use", "my setup", "workflow", "development", "testing"
3. **ideas** - Future plans, wished features, improvements user wants
   - *Indicators*: "would be nice", "future", "someday", "wish", "plan to"

## Example Actionable Insights to Extract:
- "Bug Prevention: Always run linting before showing code prevents 80% of user corrections"
- "Success Pattern: Using §m search before implementing avoids code duplication issues"
- "Quality Check: Testing with 'python3 -c' inline catches bugs faster than test files"
- "Satisfaction Driver: Showing concise implementation plan first gets quick approval"
- "Friction Point: Creating files without checking existing code causes rework"
- "Trust Builder: Validating against current codebase before changes prevents outdated solutions"
- "Efficiency Win: Batch processing with TodoWrite reduces back-and-forth by 70%"
- "Bug Pattern: Assumptions about APIs without checking docs lead to implementation errors"

Remember: The goal is extracting ACTIONABLE patterns for effective collaboration and bug-free code delivery, not personality profiling. Focus on what works, what fails, and why.
