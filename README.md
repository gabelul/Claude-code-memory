# Claude Code Memory - Unlock God Mode 🚀

⚡ **Transform Claude Code from a talented junior into a 10x senior architect with photographic memory**

🧠 **One command. 30 seconds. Claude becomes omniscient.**

Stop treating Claude like a goldfish. Give it the superpower of perfect memory and watch it become the senior developer who never forgets a single line of code.

## 🔥 Regular Claude vs God Mode Claude

**Regular Claude Code** (Without Memory):
- 🐣 "What's your project structure?" - Asked every. single. time.
- 🔄 "Let me create this function for you" - *Function already exists*
- 😴 "I don't see any similar code" - *There are 5 similar implementations*
- 🤷 "Could you show me that error handling pattern again?"
- ⏰ Wastes 10-15 minutes per session on context

**God Mode Claude** (With Memory):
- 🧙‍♂️ "I see you have 3 similar validation functions. Let me use your `validateUserInput` pattern from auth.js"
- 🎯 "This error matches the pattern you fixed in commit 3f4a2b1. Here's the same solution adapted"
- 🔮 "Based on your architecture, this belongs in `/services` with your other API handlers"
- ⚡ "Found 5 instances of this pattern. Want me to refactor them all?"
- 🚀 Starts coding immediately with full context

## ⚡ Activate God Mode in 30 Seconds

**Option 1: Let Claude Install Everything (Recommended)**
```
You: Install Claude Code Memory from https://github.com/Durafen/Claude-code-memory and help me understand how to use it

Claude: I'll help you install the complete Claude Code Memory system...
[Claude handles everything: clones repos, installs dependencies, configures settings, indexes your project]
```

**Option 2: Manual Setup**
See the [Installation section](#installation) below for step-by-step manual installation.

**After installation**, add to your project's `CLAUDE.md` file:
```markdown
## Memory Usage Instructions
You have access to a complete memory of this codebase. Before writing ANY code:
1. ALWAYS search for existing implementations first
2. Use memory to find similar patterns and follow them
3. Check for duplicate functionality before creating new functions
4. When debugging, search for similar errors that were fixed before
```

**That's it!** Claude is now in God Mode. Watch it reference your code like a senior dev who's been on your team for years.

## 🎯 What Claude Can Do in God Mode

**Smart Code Discovery:**
- 🔍 "I found 3 similar validation functions. Using your established pattern..."
- 🎯 "This matches the auth error you fixed in UserService.js. Applying the same solution..."
- 🧩 "Based on your architecture, I'll add this to the existing middleware chain..."

**Intelligent Refactoring:**
- ♻️ "I can see this pattern repeated 5 times. Let me extract it into a reusable function..."
- 🏗️ "Your naming convention uses camelCase for functions. Updating to match..."
- 📦 "This belongs in your utils folder based on your project structure..."

**Context-Aware Debugging:**
- 🐛 "This error pattern appeared in 3 other places. Here's how you fixed it..."
- 🔧 "Your error handling typically uses try-catch with custom error classes..."
- 📊 "Based on your logging patterns, I'll add debug statements here..."

  -- node "/path/to/memory/mcp-qdrant-memory/dist/index.js"
```

## 🎯 What Claude Can Do in God Mode (Automatic!)

**Claude automatically uses advanced search to help you:**

### Find Code by Concept, Not Keywords
```
You: "Show me our user validation logic"
Claude: I found 3 validation approaches in your codebase:
- `UserValidator.validate()` in services/auth.js - Main validation
- `validateEmail()` in utils/validation.js - Email-specific
- `checkUserPermissions()` in middleware/auth.js - Permission validation
```

### Understand Your Architecture Instantly  
```
You: "How does our authentication work?"
Claude: Based on your codebase structure:
- JWT tokens generated in `AuthService.generateToken()`
- Middleware validation in `authMiddleware.js`
- Refresh token logic in `TokenManager.refresh()`
- Database sessions stored via `SessionStore` class
[Shows actual code relationships]
```

### Prevent Duplicate Code
```
You: "I need a function to parse CSV files"
Claude: You already have CSV parsing implemented:
- `parseCSV()` in utils/fileHandlers.js handles basic CSV
- `CSVProcessor` class in services/data.js for advanced parsing
Would you like me to use the existing function or enhance it?
```

### Debug with Pattern Recognition
```
You: "Why is my API returning 401 errors?"
Claude: I found similar 401 errors were fixed in 3 places:
1. Missing await on `validateToken()` - fixed in commit a3f24b
2. Expired token not refreshing - fixed in `handleTokenExpiry()`
3. CORS preflight issue - fixed in middleware/cors.js
Your error matches pattern #2. Here's the fix...
```

### Technical Magic Behind God Mode
- **10+ Languages**: Tree-sitter AST parsing (same as VS Code)
- **Semantic Search**: Finds concepts, not just text matches
- **Smart Caching**: 90% faster with metadata-first architecture
- **Real Understanding**: Knows function calls, imports, inheritance
- **Cost Optimized**: Voyage AI option saves 85% on embeddings

## 💡 Common Use Cases

### Starting a New Feature
```
You: "I need to add user notifications"
Claude: Looking at your codebase, I see you have:
- Event system in `EventBus` class that could trigger notifications
- Similar alert system in `AlertService` using the observer pattern
- Database models with `User.preferences` for notification settings
I'll follow your event-driven pattern to implement this...
```

### Code Review Assistant
```
You: "Review my PR for the payment integration"
Claude: Comparing with your existing patterns:
- ✅ Follows your error handling pattern from `OrderService`
- ⚠️ Missing retry logic that you use in other external APIs
- ✅ Correctly uses your `APIClient` base class
- ⚠️ Should add logging like in `StripeIntegration`
```

### Instant Documentation
```
You: "How do I use our caching system?"
Claude: Your caching system (`CacheManager` in utils/cache.js):
- Redis-backed with automatic TTL
- Used in 12 places across the codebase
- Example from `UserService.getProfile()`:
  ```js
  const cached = await cache.get(`user:${id}`);
  if (cached) return cached;
  ```
- Set cache: `cache.set(key, value, ttl)`
- Clear cache: `cache.invalidate(pattern)`
```

### Refactoring Helper  
```
You: "This UserController is getting too big"
Claude: Your `UserController` has 847 lines. Based on your patterns:
- Authentication methods → Move to `AuthController` (like `AdminController`)
- Profile methods → Create `ProfileController` (matches your structure)
- Settings methods → Create `UserSettingsController`
This matches how you split `OrderController` into 3 controllers.
```

## 📝 Manual JSON Configuration (Advanced)
Add to `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "general-memory": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/memory/mcp-qdrant-memory/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-your-key-here",
        "QDRANT_API_KEY": "your-secret-key",
        "QDRANT_URL": "http://localhost:6333",
        "QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME": "general"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Your First God Mode Experience
```bash
# Initialize project configuration (creates .claude-indexer/config.json)
claude-indexer init -p /your/project -c my-project

# Index your project (30 seconds for most codebases)
claude-indexer -p /your/project -c my-project

# Watch the magic happen:
# ✅ Parsing 1,247 files with Tree-sitter...
# ✅ Extracting 892 functions, 234 classes...
# ✅ Building knowledge graph with 2,341 relationships...
# ✅ Generating embeddings with Voyage AI...
# ✅ Project indexed! Claude is now in God Mode.
```

**Now ask Claude anything:**
- "Find all error handling patterns in this codebase"
- "Show me functions similar to validateUser"
- "Refactor all API calls to use our new auth pattern"
- "What's the difference between our v1 and v2 authentication?"

Claude will respond with deep knowledge of YOUR specific codebase!

## 🧠 How Claude Code Uses Your Memory (Automatic!)

**You NEVER call memory functions directly.** After indexing, Claude automatically:
- Searches for existing code before writing new functions
- Finds similar patterns when debugging
- Remembers your coding style and conventions
- Tracks relationships between components

### Add This to Your Project's CLAUDE.md

```markdown
# Project Memory Instructions

You have access to a complete memory of this codebase. ALWAYS:
1. Search for existing implementations before writing new code
2. Use established patterns found in memory
3. Check for similar functions to avoid duplication
4. When debugging, search for similar errors that were fixed before
5. Follow the coding conventions found in existing code

## Memory Usage Examples
- Before creating a function: "I found 3 similar validation functions in memory..."
- When debugging: "This error pattern matches issue fixed in auth.js..."
- For refactoring: "Memory shows this pattern used in 5 places..."

## Enhanced Memory Graph Functions

### 🎯 Unified Search with entityTypes Filtering (MCP Only)
- search_similar("query", entityTypes=["metadata"]) - 90% faster overview search
- search_similar("query", entityTypes=["function", "class"]) - Find specific code elements
- search_similar("query", entityTypes=["debugging_pattern"]) - Find past error solutions
- search_similar("query", entityTypes=["documentation"]) - Search docs only
- search_similar("query", entityTypes=["function", "metadata"]) - Mixed search with OR logic

### 🔍 CLI Search Parameters
**Note**: CLI search has limited filtering compared to MCP unified entityTypes approach:
- **--type entity**: Filter by code entities (functions, classes, variables)
- **--type relation**: Filter by relationships between entities  
- **--type all**: Search all types (default behavior)
- **Missing**: No chunk_type filtering at CLI level (metadata vs implementation)

### 📊 Codebase Mapping (with safe limits)
**General Analysis:**
- read_graph(mode="smart", limit=100) - AI overview (max 150 entities)
- read_graph(mode="entities", entityTypes=["class"], limit=50) - Filtered components  
- read_graph(mode="relationships", limit=200) - Connections (max 300, careful!)

**Entity-Specific (10-20 relations vs 300+):**
- read_graph(entity="ClassName", mode="smart") - AI analysis of specific component
- read_graph(entity="functionName", mode="relationships") - Direct connections only
- read_graph(entity="ServiceName", mode="entities") - Connected components

### 🔍 Implementation Access
- get_implementation("name") - Just the code
- get_implementation("name", "logical") - Include same-file helpers (max 20)
- get_implementation("name", "dependencies") - Include imports/calls (max 30)

## Optimal Debugging Workflow

1. **Fast Discovery**: search_similar("error", entityTypes=["metadata", "debugging_pattern"])
2. **Focus Analysis**: read_graph(entity="ProblemFunction", mode="smart")
3. **Code Details**: get_implementation("ProblemFunction", "dependencies")
4. **Store Solution**: After fixing, add pattern to memory for future

## Memory Power User Shortcuts (Optional)

Add these to your CLAUDE.md for enhanced memory usage:

- "§m" = Use project memory to find implementations, patterns, and architectural decisions
- "§d" = **Memory-search first for similar patterns, project memory if there is**, replicate the problem first, understand what is the error/problem ((same parameters and context) if you don't sure, ask!), use entity-specific debugging: search_similar to find target entity, then read_graph(entity="EntityName", mode="smart") for focused analysis (10-20 relations vs 300+), read related project logs, then debug deeper to find root cause (problem-focused, not solution-focused), show plan for fixing, if more info needed add debug prints. Don't fix until you made sure your fix will fix the exact same problem, just present findings (after receiving ok, fix with no code duping, check other possible function first, and do a test in the end to make sure this specific problem with this context and parameter solved).
- "$dup" = Don't duplicate code, check twice if there's a function that already does something similar prior to implementing what you want (use memory to check relations and best practices).

Note: This is my personal workflow that works well with Claude Code Memory.

## 💬 Real Claude Code Conversations (Before vs After)

**Without Memory:**
```
You: Fix the authentication error in my API
Claude: I'll help you fix the authentication error. Could you show me:
- Your authentication code
- The error message
- Your project structure
- Any middleware you're using
```

**With Memory (God Mode):**
```
You: Fix the authentication error in my API
Claude: I found the authentication error. Looking at your codebase:
- Your AuthService.validateToken() is throwing when tokens expire
- You have a similar pattern in RefreshTokenService that handles this
- I'll apply the same try-catch pattern you used there:

[Shows exact fix using YOUR code patterns]
```

## 📋 Adding New Projects

### Step 1: Add MCP Collection

**Option 1: Built-in CLI Command (Recommended)**
```bash
# From your project directory
claude-indexer add-mcp -c my-project -p .

# Or from any directory
claude-indexer add-mcp -c my-project -p /path/to/project
```

**Option 2: Command Line**
```bash
claude mcp add my-project-memory -e OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_KEY" -e QDRANT_API_KEY="YOUR_QDRANT_KEY" -e QDRANT_URL="http://localhost:6333" -e QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME="my-project" -- node "/path/to/memory/mcp-qdrant-memory/dist/index.js"
```

**Option 3: Manual JSON Configuration**
Add to `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
"my-project-memory": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["/path/to/memory/mcp-qdrant-memory/dist/index.js"],
  "env": {
    "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-your-key-here",
    "QDRANT_API_KEY": "your-secret-key", 
    "QDRANT_URL": "http://localhost:6333",
    "QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME": "my-project"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Restart Claude Code

### Step 3: Initialize Project Configuration (Optional)
```bash
# Create project-specific configuration file with auto-detected name
claude-indexer init -c my-project -p /path/to/your/project

# For current directory
claude-indexer init -c my-project -p .
```

### Step 4: Index Your Project
```bash
# Basic indexing (auto-loads to Qdrant)
# First run: Full mode (auto-detected), subsequent runs: Incremental mode (auto-detected)
claude-indexer -p /path/to/your/project -c my-project

# With verbose output to see detailed progress
claude-indexer -p /path/to/your/project -c my-project --verbose
```

### Step 5: Automatic Knowledge Graph Loading
Knowledge graph is automatically loaded into Qdrant - no manual steps required!

### Step 6: Test Entity-Specific Graph Filtering (NEW v2.8)
```bash
# In Claude Code - Focus on specific entities for targeted debugging
mcp__my-project-memory__read_graph(entity="AuthService", mode="smart")
# Returns: AI summary of AuthService connections, dependencies, usage patterns

# Debug specific function relationships
mcp__my-project-memory__read_graph(entity="process_login", mode="relationships") 
# Returns: Only relations involving process_login (10-20 vs 300+ scattered)

# Find entities connected to specific component
mcp__my-project-memory__read_graph(entity="validate_token", mode="entities")
# Returns: All entities that connect to validate_token

# Enhanced semantic scope implementation access (v2.4.1)
mcp__my-project-memory__get_implementation("entityName")  # minimal scope (default)
mcp__my-project-memory__get_implementation("entityName", "logical")  # same-file helpers  
mcp__my-project-memory__get_implementation("entityName", "dependencies")  # imports/calls
```

## 🎯 Best Practices for God Mode

### 1. Keep Your Memory Fresh
```bash
# Quick re-index after major changes
claude-indexer -p /project -c my-project
# Runs in seconds with incremental mode
```

### 2. Use Descriptive Collection Names
```bash
# Good: Matches your project
claude-indexer -p ~/projects/auth-api -c auth-api

# Bad: Generic names
claude-indexer -p ~/projects/auth-api -c project1
```

### 3. Let Claude Learn Your Style
- Index your best code first
- Include well-documented modules
- Keep test files - Claude learns from test patterns too

### 4. Multiple Projects? Multiple Collections
```bash
# Each project gets its own memory (run from each project directory)
claude-indexer add-mcp -c frontend-app -p .
claude-indexer add-mcp -c backend-api -p .
claude-indexer add-mcp -c mobile-app -p .

# Or specify paths from anywhere
claude-indexer add-mcp -c frontend-app -p ~/projects/frontend
claude-indexer add-mcp -c backend-api -p ~/projects/backend
claude-indexer add-mcp -c mobile-app -p ~/projects/mobile
```

### 5. What Claude Sees in God Mode

When you ask about code, Claude instantly knows:
- Every function/class in your codebase
- How components relate to each other
- Your naming conventions and patterns
- Similar code that already exists
- Past solutions to similar problems

## 🔄 Direct Qdrant Integration

Direct Qdrant integration with zero manual steps:
```bash
# Index new project (auto-loads to Qdrant)
claude-indexer -p /path/to/project -c project-name

# Auto-detection: First run = Full mode, subsequent runs = Incremental mode (15x faster)
# No flags needed - automatically uses optimal mode based on project-local state file (.claude-indexer/{collection}.json)

# Clear collection (preserves manually added memories)
claude-indexer -p /path/to/project -c project-name --clear

## ⚙️ Service Configuration

The background service uses `~/.claude-indexer/config.json` for persistent configuration across multiple projects and file watching behavior. State files are stored project-locally in `{project}/.claude-indexer/{collection}.json` for better team collaboration and project portability.

### Default Configuration
```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "path": "/Users/username/Python-Projects/memory",
      "collection": "memory",
      "watch_enabled": true
    }
  ],
  "settings": {
    "debounce_seconds": 2.0,
    "watch_patterns": ["*.py", "*.md"],
    "ignore_patterns": [
      "*.pyc", "__pycache__", ".git", ".venv", 
      "node_modules", ".env", "*.log"
    ],
    "max_file_size": 1048576,
    "enable_logging": true
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

- **`debounce_seconds`**: Delay before processing file changes (prevents rapid re-indexing during active editing)
- **`watch_patterns`**: File extensions to monitor for changes (supports glob patterns)
- **`ignore_patterns`**: Files/directories to skip during watching (performance optimization)
- **`max_file_size`**: Maximum file size in bytes for processing (default 1MB)
- **`enable_logging`**: Enable/disable detailed service logging

### Customizing Service Behavior

**Edit Configuration File:**
```bash
# Create or edit service configuration
vi ~/.claude-indexer/config.json

# Or let service create default config on first run
claude-indexer service start
```

**Add Projects to Service:**
```bash
# Add project to background watching
claude-indexer service add-project /path/to/project project-collection-name

# Start background service (watches all configured projects)
claude-indexer service start

# Check service status
claude-indexer service status
```

**Performance Tuning:**
- **Increase `debounce_seconds`** (3.0-5.0) for large projects with frequent changes
- **Reduce `watch_patterns`** to only essential file types for better performance
- **Add specific paths** to `ignore_patterns` for directories with many temporary files
- **Adjust `max_file_size`** based on your largest source files

### Multi-Project Configuration Example
```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "path": "/home/dev/web-app",
      "collection": "webapp-memory",
      "watch_enabled": true
    },
    {
      "path": "/home/dev/api-service", 
      "collection": "api-memory",
      "watch_enabled": true
    }
  ],
  "settings": {
    "debounce_seconds": 3.0,
    "watch_patterns": ["*.py", "*.js", "*.ts", "*.md"],
    "ignore_patterns": ["*.pyc", "__pycache__", ".git", ".venv", "node_modules", "dist", "build"]
  }
}
```

## 🎯 When to Use Each Mode

- **Basic Indexing**: Auto-detects Full/Incremental mode - no flags needed (just `claude-indexer -p X -c Y`)
- **File Watching**: Active development sessions, real-time feedback (`claude-indexer watch start`)
- **Background Service**: Multiple projects, continuous development (`claude-indexer service start`)
- **Git Hooks**: Team workflows, automated CI/CD integration (`claude-indexer hooks install`)

### CLI Interface Improvements

**Simplified Basic Usage:**
- No need for `index` command - basic usage is `claude-indexer -p X -c Y`
- Use `-p` and `-c` shortcuts instead of `--project` and `--collection` for faster typing
- Running `claude-indexer` with no arguments shows comprehensive help
- Help displays both indexing options and available commands in one view

**Smart Command Routing:**
- Basic indexing options work directly with main command
- Advanced features available through subcommands (hooks, watch, service, search, file)
- Backward compatibility maintained - all existing functionality preserved
- Cleaner interface while keeping full feature set

## 🐛 Debugging Protocol

### Memory-First Debugging Workflow

**Step 1: Search Similar Patterns (Enhanced with Unified Filtering)**
```bash
# Fast metadata-only search for quick debugging (90% faster)
mcp__project-memory__search_similar("error pattern", entityTypes=["metadata"])

# Find error patterns + related functions
mcp__project-memory__search_similar("null pointer", entityTypes=["debugging_pattern", "function"])

# Search everything when unsure
mcp__project-memory__search_similar("authentication error")
```

**Step 2: Understand Problem Context**
```bash
# Read project relationships to understand connections
mcp__project-memory__read_graph(mode="relationships", limit=300)

# Get entity overview for context
mcp__project-memory__read_graph(mode="smart", limit=100)

# Focus on specific entities
mcp__project-memory__read_graph(mode="entities", entityTypes=["class","function"], limit=200)
```

**Step 3: Entity-Specific Analysis (NEW v2.7)**
```bash
# Find relevant entities with smart filtering
mcp__project-memory__search_similar("authentication function", entityTypes=["function", "class", "metadata"])

# Focus on specific entity with AI summary
mcp__project-memory__read_graph(entity="AuthService", mode="smart")
# Returns: Connection stats, key relationships, entity breakdown

# See only relationships for debugging
mcp__project-memory__read_graph(entity="process_login", mode="relationships") 
# Returns: 10-20 focused relations instead of 300+ scattered ones

# Get implementation with semantic scope
mcp__project-memory__get_implementation("EntityName", "minimal")
mcp__project-memory__get_implementation("EntityName", "logical")
mcp__project-memory__get_implementation("EntityName", "dependencies")
```

**Step 4: Root Cause Analysis**
- **Problem-focused approach**: Understand the exact error/problem with same parameters and context
- **Replicate first**: Ensure you can reproduce the issue before proposing fixes
- **Deep investigation**: Continue searching deeper until root cause is identified
- **Validation**: Don't fix until certain the solution addresses the exact problem

**Step 5: Solution Implementation**
- **Check for duplicates**: Verify no existing functions solve the problem ($dup)
- **Test implementation**: Run tests to ensure the specific problem is solved
- **Store solution patterns**: Add insights to project memory for future reference

### Debug Commands Reference

**Log Analysis:**
```bash
# Application logs location
{project_path}/logs/{collection_name}.log

# Monitor real-time logs
tail -f {project_path}/logs/{collection_name}.log

# Check service logs with verbose output
claude-indexer service status --verbose
```

**Memory Graph Functions:**
```bash
# Entity-specific graph filtering (NEW v2.7)
read_graph(entity="AuthService", mode="smart")      # AI summary of entity connections
read_graph(entity="process_login", mode="relationships")  # Only relations for entity
read_graph(entity="validate_token", mode="entities")     # Entities connected to target

# General graph views (legacy)
read_graph(mode="relationships", limit=300)  # Full relations view
read_graph(mode="smart", limit=100)          # AI-optimized overview  
read_graph(mode="entities", entityTypes=["class","function"], limit=200)  # Type-filtered
read_graph(mode="raw", limit=50)             # Raw data dump
```

**Implementation Access:**
```bash
# Just the entity (default)
get_implementation("ClassName", "minimal")

# Entity + same-file helpers
get_implementation("ClassName", "logical") 

# Entity + imports/calls
get_implementation("ClassName", "dependencies")

# 🎯 Unified Memory Search Examples for End Users

# Quick function/class discovery  
search_similar("authentication", entityTypes=["function", "class"], limit=10)

# Fast overview search (90% speed boost)
search_similar("error handling", entityTypes=["metadata"], limit=10)               

# Mixed smart search - functions OR fast metadata
search_similar("validation logic", entityTypes=["function", "metadata"], limit=10)   

# Documentation and guides only
search_similar("api documentation", entityTypes=["documentation"], limit=10)

# Deep code search when you need implementation details
search_similar("complex algorithm", entityTypes=["implementation"], limit=10)

# Everything - let Claude decide what's most relevant (default)
search_similar("database connection", limit=10)
```

**🔧 Enhanced Debugging Best Practices with Unified Filtering:**
- **Smart Error Search**: Use `entityTypes=["debugging_pattern", "function"]` to find similar error solutions  
- **Fast Metadata Scan**: Use `entityTypes=["metadata"]` for 90% faster initial problem identification
- **Function-Focused Debug**: Use `entityTypes=["function", "class"]` when troubleshooting specific code
- **Mixed Context Search**: Use `entityTypes=["function", "metadata", "implementation"]` for comprehensive analysis
- **Separate Collections**: Always use test collections (watcher-test, debug-test) for debugging
- **Clean Test Data**: Use 1-2 files only for cleaner debug output  
- **Production Safety**: Never contaminate production memory collections during testing
- **Store Solutions**: Store solution patterns and insights, not just bug information
- **Smart Categorization**: Use debugging_pattern, implementation_pattern, integration_pattern for organized memory

> **💡 Tip for End Users**: Add this debugging protocol to your project's `CLAUDE.md` file so Claude automatically follows these steps during debugging sessions. This ensures consistent memory-first debugging across all your projects.

## 📋 Memory Management & Cleanup

### Manual Memory Cleanup Workflow
Streamline your memory collection with intelligent cleanup tools:

```bash
# 1. Generate task list from your memory collection
python utils/make_manuals_list.py -c your-collection-name -o memories.md

# 2. Review the generated memories.md file with checkbox format
# Each entry shows: [ ] **Title** (ID: `number`) - description

# 3. Use Claude with the cleanup prompt to process entries
# Copy prompts/clean_manual_entries.md prompt to Claude
# Claude will process 10 entries at a time, marking progress with [X]

# 4. Track progress - entries marked as:
# [X] = processed/validated
# [D] = deleted as duplicate/outdated
# [ ] = unprocessed
```

### Manual Memory Backup & Restore
Protect your valuable manual memories (analysis notes, insights, patterns) with automated backup/restore:

```bash
# Backup all manual entries from a collection
python utils/backup_manual_entries.py backup -c memory-project

# Generate MCP restore commands for manual entries
python utils/backup_manual_entries.py restore -f manual_entries_backup_memory-project.json

# Execute restore automatically via MCP (no manual steps)
python utils/backup_manual_entries.py restore -f manual_entries_backup_memory-project.json --execute

# Dry run to see what would be restored
python utils/backup_manual_entries.py restore -f backup.json --dry-run

# List supported manual entry types
python utils/backup_manual_entries.py --list-types
```

**Smart Classification:**
- **97 manual entries** correctly identified vs **1,838 auto-indexed** entries
- **Automation detection** via `file_path`, `collection`, `line_number` fields  
- **Manual structure** only: `type`, `name`, `entityType`, `observations`
- **Relevant relations**: Only backs up 2 relations connected to manual entries (vs 1,867 total)

**Use Cases:**
- **Pre-clearing**: Backup manual memories before `--clear-all` operations
- **Project migration**: Move manual insights between collections
- **Team sharing**: Export/import manual analysis and patterns
- **Disaster recovery**: Restore valuable manual entries after data loss
